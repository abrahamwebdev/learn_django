Creating a View
Now that we've created an app we can start modifying some files within our app to create our first web page (aka view).
To do this we will go into our apps root directory and modify the file called views.py

Linking to our View
Now that we've created a view we need to create a url to link to it. To do this we need to create a new python file called urls.py.
